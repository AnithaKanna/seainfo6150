9.  What makes a site usable?

1.  Note: ideally, principles should be implemented by UX designer

1.  Often, designers have print background, little/no web design experience

2.  As developer, you will find yourself advising on design!

3.  No "average user"

1.  Every person uses web differently

2.  All web users are unique

1.  intuitive navigation

1.  Ideally user should not have to think hard about where to click next

2.  Pain-free moving from point to point

3.  Navigation is not just a feature, it IS the website

3.  Test for good navigation

1.  If landing on a deep-linked page of the site (eg from search), can your user answer these questions:

1.  What site is this?

2.  What page am I on?

3.  What are the major sections of the site?

4.  What are my options at this level?

5.  Where am I in the overall site?

4.  What should I be here and not somewhere else?

3.  Clear hierarchy

1.  Outliner: <https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/>

1.  Every HTML document has an "outline," which is how search engines and screen readers view the hierarchy of the content on the page

2.  Outline helps adapt the way they present information to the users according to the structure of the document

3.  Stronger hierarchy + semantic markup, the easier it is for search engines, screen readers, and other machines to identify the different parts of your website.

3.  Logically related = visually related

4.  Nesting

5.  Clearly defined areas of functionality/content

5.  Focus user attention

1.  "front-load" with the important and unique identifying information first.

2.  Poor: Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | About Us

3.  Good: About Us | Acme Web Solutions, Inc.

6.  Image alt text

1.  used by people who do not see the image

2.  Every image should include alt in the markup

1.  If conveys information for interacting with or understanding the page content, then it needs alternative text.

2.  If just decorative, should have null alt (alt="")

4.  Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text

1.  avoid where possible!

2.  Will help with searchability too.

8.  Multimedia

1.  Captions and other alternatives for multimedia

2.  Users can pause, stop, or change audio volume

3.  Background audio is low or can be turned off (distracting)

4.  Content does not cause seizures (flashing/blinking)

10. Headings

1.  Hierarchy + logical page structure!

1.  Eg screen readers navigate by jumping from header to header, section to section

4.  pages should have at least one heading

5.  Mark up all conceptual section heading as headings

6.  start page with an "h1"

2.  Includes older people who lose contrast sensitivity

3.  Low luminance

1.  some people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia need low luminance

2.  bright colors (high luminance) not readable

5.  browsers should allow changing color of text and background

6.  web pages need to work when people change colors

7.  Don't use color as only way of showing/highlighting info or contrast

1.  Eg colored links w/no underline

14. Text resize

1.  Some users need to enlarge web content to read

2.  Most browsers allow users to change text size through settings, text zoom, page zoom

3.  Pages can be unusable when the text size is changed

1.  Text overlapping

2.  Text cut off

3.  Horizontal scrolling (some disabilities make horizontal scrolling impossible)

5.  Ensure that changing text size allows users to comfortably view text

16. Touch access

1.  Large touch target so that people with motor challenges can activate easily

2.  Min recommended 48px x 48px touch area

18. Keyboard access

1.  Many users cannot use a mouse & rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web

1.  blind people

2.  sighted people with mobility impairments

3.  Users of assistive technologies that rely on keyboard commands eg voice input

3.  Accessible websites enable keyboard access to all content and functionality

1.  Links

2.  Forms

3.  media controls

5.  keyboard focus

1.  Should be visible

2.  Users who cannot use the mouse should be able to tab through elements

3.  Should follow a logical order through the page elements when tabbing

4.  default tab order = order of DOM position of native elements

5.  Tabindex

1.  ability to modify the tab order

2.  Set tabindex on element

3.  Tabindex = 0, make an element tabbable

4.  Tabindex = -1, remove ability to tab to element

5.  Tabindex > 0 = lets element cut in line ahead of natural order

1.  Avoid whenever possible!

2.  restrict tabindex to custom interactive elements user might provide input to

1.  buttons, tabs, dropdowns, and text fields

20. WAI-ARIA

1.  Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite

2.  defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities

3.  defining new ways for assistive technology to interactive with ajax, javascript, etc.

4.  Examples:

1.  drag-and-drop functionality that is not available to users who use a keyboard only and cannot use a mouse

2.  Content that changes after the page is loaded that cannot be detected by users who are blind

6.  WAI-ARIA can define how information about functionality can be provided to assistive technology

1.  provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features

2.  Designed to fill the gap between standard HTML tags and the desktop-style controls found in dynamic web applications

3.  should always prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA

8.  3 different types of attributes

1.  Roles: describe widgets that aren't otherwise available in HTML 4 and below, such as sliders, menu bars, tabs, and dialogs

2.  Properties: describe characteristics of these widgets, eg if they are draggable

3.  States: describe the current interaction state of an element (busy, disabled, selected, or hidden)

10. ARIA example: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets>

11. <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA>

13. Tools

1.  Validators

1.  Why validate?

1.  debugging tool (cross browser consistency)

2.  Future proofing (not relying on quirks)

3.  Maintainability (adhering to agreed standards)

4.  Good habits

3.  HTML: <https://validator.w3.org/>

1.  HTML document is valid if it syntactically conforms to DTD (document type definition) for a version of HTML

1.  Order allowed, what elements can be children of which, etc.

3.  Cannot validate how HTML will be rendered (cross browser consistency)

5.  CSS: <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator>
