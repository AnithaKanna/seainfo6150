        41. contribute to the bottom line and improve customer satisfaction

5. What makes a site usable?

    21. Note: ideally, principles should be implemented by UX designer

        42. Often, designers have print background, little/no web design experience

        43. As developer, you will find yourself advising on design!

    22. No "average user"

        44. Every person uses web differently

        45. All web users are unique

        46. No right answers for web design

        47. So how do we know what usable means?

        48. Good integrated design that fills a need ("useful")

            28. Carefully thought out

            29. Well executed

            30. Tested!

            31. Example: "I hate videos!"

                26. I hate 4 minute videos where the actual content I wanted is at 3:30

                27. I appreciate videos that show me how to do something or are full of content from 0:01

                28. Well executed!

    23. Users don’t want to think

        49. ["Don’t Make Me Think" book](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=PXRTM59H7VCHWQ0A4J7F)

        50. Users read, not scan → wireframes

    24. Availability and Accessibility (useful, usable, findable, credible)

        51. No broken links

        52. Helpful error/404 pages

            32. Increase credibility by showing expertise/helpfulness even in error state

            33. Help your user get back to the familiar or find their way out

                29. Navigation

                30. Search box

        53. Mobile responsiveness

            34. make sure site can handle different screen sizes and slow connections

            35. Throttling

            36. Chrome dev tools example

    25. Conventionality (usable, findable)

        54. Look to norms & standards

        55. Eg. our newspaper sites

            37. All look very similar, people become trained as to what "a newspaper site" looks like

        56. Certain web design conventions users have become familiar with

            38. main navigation be at the top (or left)

            39. logo at the top left (or center)

            40. logo is clickable to the homepage

            41. links change color/appearance on hover

            42. Links change color/appearance on visit

            43. "You are here" indicator

            44. Footer has "site map" links

            45. Shopping cart icon on ecommerce site

        57. take advantage of knowing what types of web experiences user is familiar with

            46. Follow users’ expectations

                31. understand what they expect from navigation, text structure, search placement etc

            47. When you put elements where users expect, they feel confident

                32. gain user trust

                33. prove your credibility

        58. Discoverability = degree of ease user can find all the elements and features of a new system when they first encounter it

            48. Conventionality aids in discoverability!

    26. Consistency (findable)

        59. being consistent can have a positive impact on usability and UX

        60. create a consistent experience across your entire website

            49. keep visitors oriented & grounded

                34.  better sense of orientation = the more trust they can develop towards the site (credibility)

            50. Backgrounds, color palette, typefaces, tone of writing

            51. Similar structure for similar content

                35. Templates & components!

                36. make it easier for visitors to understand what type of information they're likely to find on a given page

    27. Navigability (findability)

        61. intuitive navigation

            52. Ideally user should not have to think hard about where to click next

            53. Pain-free moving from point to point

            54. Navigation is not just a feature, it IS the website

        62. Test for good navigation

            55. If landing on a deep-linked page of the site (eg from search), can your user answer these questions:

                37. What site is this?

                38. What page am I on?

                39. What are the major sections of the site?

                40. What are my options at this level?

                41. Where am I in the overall site?

                42. How can I search?

        63. optimizing navigation

            56. primary navigation simple & near the top of the page

            57. Include navigation in footer

            58. breadcrumbs

            59. Keyword search box near the top of page

            60. Include very clear links within page content

            61. Make it obvious what’s clickable!

                43. Link? Button?

            62. Name of page matched what the user clicked

    28. Understandability

        64. obvious and self-explanatory

            63. Don’t make users think! (or read)

            64. get rid of question marks -> the decisions users need to make consciously

            65. Understand user’s mental model and how they would expect content to be structured

            66. User should immediately understand about site:

                44. What is site for?

                45. What does the site have for me?

                46. What can I do here?

                47. What should I be here and not somewhere else?

        65. Clear hierarchy

            67. Outliner: [https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/](https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/)

                48. Every HTML document has an "outline," which is how search engines and screen readers view the hierarchy of the content on the page

                49. Outline helps adapt the way they present information to the users according to the structure of the document

                50. Stronger hierarchy + semantic markup, the easier it is for search engines, screen readers, and other machines to identify the different parts of your website.

            68. Logically related = visually related

            69. Nesting

            70. Clearly defined areas of functionality/content

        66. Focus user attention

            71. Clear visual hierarchy

                51. More important = more prominent

            72. users recognize edges, patterns and motions

            73. Draw the eye and lead the user with elements that stand out

                52. Bold color

                53. Bold text

                54. Animation/motion

    29. [https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)

    30. [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0)

    31. [https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/)

    32. Page titles

        67. Good title = important for orientation

            75. help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser

        68. The first thing screen readers say is page title

        69. Should be unique & adequately distinguish the page between windows/tabs

        70. Should briefly describe the content of the page

            76. "front-load" with the important and unique identifying information first.

            77. Poor: Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | About Us

            78. Good: About Us | Acme Web Solutions, Inc.

    33. Image alt text

        71. used by people who do not see the image

        72. Every image should include alt in the markup

            79. If conveys information for interacting with or understanding the page content, then it needs alternative text.

            80. If just decorative, should have null alt (alt="")

        73. Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text

            81. avoid where possible!

            82. Will help with searchability too.

    34. Multimedia

        74. Captions and other alternatives for multimedia

        75. Users can pause, stop, or change audio volume

        76. Background audio is low or can be turned off (distracting)

        77. Content does not cause seizures (flashing/blinking)

    35. Headings

        78. Hierarchy + logical page structure!

            83. Eg screen readers navigate by jumping from header to header, section to section

            84. Semantic html makes content findable

        79. The page has a heading

        80. pages should have at least one heading

        81. Mark up all conceptual section heading as headings

        82. start page with an "h1"

    36. Color contrast

        83. High contrast

            85. some people with visual impairments need high contrast (dark text + light background or bright text + dark background)

            86. Includes older people who lose contrast sensitivity

        84. Low luminance

            87. some people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia need low luminance

            88. bright colors (high luminance) not readable

        85. browsers should allow changing color of text and background

        86. web pages need to work when people change colors

        87. Don’t use color as only way of showing/highlighting info or contrast

            89. Eg colored links w/no underline

    37. Text resize

        88. Some users need to enlarge web content to read

        89. Most browsers allow users to change text size through settings, text zoom, page zoom

        90. Pages can be unusable when the text size is changed

            90. Text overlapping

            91. Text cut off

            92. Horizontal scrolling (some disabilities make horizontal scrolling impossible)

        91. Ensure that changing text size allows users to comfortably view text

    38. Touch access

        92. Large touch target so that people with motor challenges can activate easily

        93. Min recommended 48px x 48px touch area

    39. Keyboard access

        94. Many users cannot use a mouse & rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web

            93. blind people

            94. sighted people with mobility impairments

            95. Users of assistive technologies that rely on keyboard commands eg voice input

        95. Accessible websites enable keyboard access to all content and functionality

            96. Links

            97. Forms

            98. media controls

        96. keyboard focus

            99. Should be visible

            100. Users who cannot use the mouse should be able to tab through elements

            101. Should follow a logical order through the page elements when tabbing

            102. default tab order = order of DOM position of native elements

            103. Tabindex

                55. ability to modify the tab order

                56. Set tabindex on element

                57. Tabindex = 0, make an element tabbable

                58. Tabindex = -1, remove ability to tab to element

                59. Tabindex > 0 = lets element cut in line ahead of natural order

                    1. Avoid whenever possible!

                    2. restrict tabindex to custom interactive elements user might provide input to

                        1. buttons, tabs, dropdowns, and text fields

    40. WAI-ARIA

        97. Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite

        98. defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities

        99. defining new ways for assistive technology to interactive with ajax, javascript, etc.

        100. Examples:

            104. drag-and-drop functionality that is not available to users who use a keyboard only and cannot use a mouse

            105. Content that changes after the page is loaded that cannot be detected by users who are blind

        101. WAI-ARIA can define how information about functionality can be provided to assistive technology

            106. provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features

            107. Designed to fill the gap between standard HTML tags and the desktop-style controls found in dynamic web applications

            108. should always prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA

        102. 3 different types of attributes

            109. Roles: describe widgets that aren't otherwise available in HTML 4 and below, such as sliders, menu bars, tabs, and dialogs

            110. Properties: describe characteristics of these widgets, eg if they are draggable

            111. States: describe the current interaction state of an element (busy, disabled, selected, or hidden)

        103. ARIA example: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets)
